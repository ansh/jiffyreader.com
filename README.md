If there is interest, I am happy to work on this more and make it a dedicated screen reader.

## What is Bionic Reading?
Bionic Reading is a new method facilitating the reading process by guiding the eyes through text with artficial fixation points.
As a result, the reader is only focusing on the highlighted initial letters and lets the brain center complete the word.
In a digital world dominated by shallow forms of reading, Bionic Reading aims to encourage a more in-depth reading and understanding of written content.
